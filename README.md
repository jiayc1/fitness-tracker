Overview: 

This is a workout tracker where I have to create a Mongo Database with Mongoose schema and handle routes with Express. Users are able to view, create, and track their daily workouts.


Acceptance Criteria: 

The user should be able to:

  * Add exercises to the most recent workout plan.

  * Add new exercises to a new workout plan.

  * View the combined weight of multiple exercises from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page.

  * View the total duration of each workout from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page.
